#Twitter Bot that will Post for You!

1. To get started just download this application and change the values in the config.js file to your own configuration values that you can get at https://apps.twitter.com
2. You will want to change to messages your bot sends out so go to bot.js and change the values in the messages variable to the messages you want you bot to post.
3. Finally you are going to want to set a time interval for your bot to post, so go the the bottom function called setInterval and change the number to your desired value. (Hint: multiply the time desired by 30,000)
